            "Infiniwell is an AI company that three other students and I worked with during our bachelor´s assignment. Their plan is to contribute to digitalization of health care by automating patient diagnostics with the help of artificial intelligence and patient monitors that streams data directly to healthcare professionals. In our thesis we described our development of a mobile application for Infiniwell. The mobile application recieves data from patient monitors through a cloud-based service. Infiniwell's goal is to streamline healthcare professionals workday by decreasing time spent on administrative tasks, and assist in clinical desicion making. To reach this goal, healthcare professionals need a useful and user friendly mobile application.",

As we never could agree to a movie, I decided to create this website to display all our movie wishes. It uses open APIs to show a trailer of the movie typed in and to get a score of the movie somewhat close to IMDB. Each logged-in user can vote up or down for a movie. I also experimented with this website by using GraphQL with React, TypeScript and Next.js for server-side-rendering.",
